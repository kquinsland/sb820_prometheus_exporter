"""Initially the plan was to implement a 'modem-type' pattern where model-specific html parse ... etc would be implemented in separate modules.
This was abandoned in favor of a more generic approach.

But I don't have multiple families of cable modem to test this and - from the screenshots I find online - all SB modems seem more or less the same.
So it might be the case that the code - as written - will work beyond the SB8200 modem that I've been testing against.
